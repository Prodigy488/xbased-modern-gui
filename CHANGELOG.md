# xbased changelog

## 1.0.7 (2026-11)

### New
- Updates: as the dashboard starts, xbased looks for a newer release on
  GitHub and offers it: Update, Not now, or Don't ask again. Update downloads
  it and installs it over this copy (the Windows folder, or the Linux
  AppImage), then starts it; settings, saves, states and the hard disk stay
  as they are. Settings › Interface › Check for updates at startup turns the
  check back on (or off). A copy that can't replace itself opens the
  release's page instead.
- Audio output, in Settings › Audio: Stereo (the default) or 5.1 surround.
  In 5.1 the console reports Dolby Digital, the games mix for six speakers,
  and xbased plays the six channels (front, center, subwoofer, rear); on
  stereo speakers the system mixes them down. Stereo is now set whatever an
  older console image (EEPROM) had kept.

## 1.0.6 (2026-11)

### Picture
- Internal resolution up to 8x (5120x3840 for a 640x480 game), from 4x:
  5x and 6x for 4K screens, 7x and 8x as supersampling. A target too big for
  the GPU's largest image at the chosen scale renders at the largest one that
  fits. Fable plays at its full 30 fps at 8x.

## 1.0.5 (2026-11)

### Credits
- xbased is crazyriddler's Windows and Linux edition of hakuX by rfandango,
  and now says so everywhere: the About screen (in every language, with
  github.com/crazyriddler/xbased), the README, the program's version
  information on Windows and its desktop entry on Linux.

## 1.0.4 (2026-11)

### Fixes
- Fable: it stopped on a black screen as it booted. Its own memory pager
  leaves each page fault with an IRETD, which the core didn't run. Fable now
  plays.
- Games on a console set to a language their disc doesn't have (Spanish on
  Fable, The Thing, Call of Duty: Finest Hour...): they start in English, as a
  console would have them do. Swapping in the English files under the other
  language's name wasn't enough: Fable saw that language's folder missing,
  loaded half of it and crashed.
- The Thing: it stopped at boot. The kernel now has I/O completion ports
  (CreateIoCompletionPort, GetQueuedCompletionStatus,
  PostQueuedCompletionStatus), with packets from reads and writes of the
  files tied to them. The Thing plays.

## 1.0.3 (2026-11)

### Fixes
- Windows: the "disc is dirty or damaged" message in games that copy disc
  files to their cache on the hard disk (Panzer Dragoon Orta and others).
  Such a game writes each file under a temporary name and renames it while
  it is still open, which Windows refused: the cache stayed broken and the
  game reported a bad disc. Files are now opened so they can be renamed or
  deleted while open, as on the Xbox and on Linux. Panzer Dragoon Orta plays
  its stages.

## 1.0.2 (2026-11)

### Fixes
- Games that stopped forever on a loading screen while one of their threads
  waited for another of the same priority (NFL Fever 2004 before its
  matches): giving up the CPU now takes a step off a thread's wait boost, as
  on the Xbox, so the thread it waits for runs. NFL Fever 2004 plays its
  matches at full speed.

## 1.0.1 (2026-11)

Fixes for games that stopped with their "disc is dirty or damaged" message,
or closed at start.

### Fixes
- Windows: xbased in a folder whose path has an accent, an ñ or letters of
  another alphabet (`C:\Users\José\...`) put its virtual hard disk in another
  folder, or nowhere. Games that write their cache then stopped with the
  dirty-disc message, or closed. xbased now uses UTF-8 paths throughout.
- Windows: when xbased's folder can't be written (Program Files, a read-only
  copy, Windows' controlled folder access on Desktop or Documents), its data
  goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\xbased` instead of failing.
- Disc images trimmed too far by an image tool: reads past the image's end
  return zeros, as on the disc, instead of the dirty-disc message.
- Disc images whose directory tree an image tool left damaged: every file is
  still found.
- A disc read that fails is tried again, through a path the emulated
  console's memory protection can't refuse.
- Memory: an allocation too big to fit gives back what it took. Games that
  ask for all the memory they can get (BloodRayne 2) closed at start; they
  run now.

## 1.0 (2026-11)

The first release of xbased, crazyriddler's Windows and Linux edition of
[hakuX](https://github.com/rfandango/hakuX) by rfandango.

### Emulation
- hakuX's core on x86-64: the guest's code translated to native x86-64, its
  return addresses predicted, interrupts delivered at block boundaries.
- The Xbox kernel's thread priority boosts, so games that lean on them
  (NightFire and others) keep their frame rate.
- Frame-rate unlock, per game, that reaches hundreds of frames per second
  where the game allows it, and that sleeps instead of spinning when capped
  (low power on laptops and handhelds).
- Per-game patches as mods (higher frame rates for a set of games so far),
  toggled per game. IPS patches shared online work too: drop them into
  `mods/<TITLE ID>/` (MODS.md).
- Anisotropic filtering up to 16x, alongside FXAA, internal resolution and
  upscaling.
- Games start in the console's language, or in English when the disc doesn't
  have that language's files.
- Save states with thumbnails, 10 slots per game.

### Front end
- A console-style dashboard: animated orb, hexagons and fog, 3D transitions,
  navigation sounds (can be turned off), a clock.
- Game library with box art (libretro-thumbnails) and the discs' own icons.
- Per-game settings, mods and cheats, controls and states.
- Memory manager for the games' own saves, with their icons: export, import,
  delete.
- In-game menu (F1, or Back + Start on a gamepad): resume, states, settings,
  controls, restart, quit.
- Borderless full screen by default, like a console; Exit from the dashboard,
  with a confirmation, so it closes from a gamepad.
- Controls: any key, button or axis per input, 4 players, per-game mappings,
  configurable shortcuts; prompts follow the device in use.
- CRT filters (scanlines, TV, arcade), frame counter, volume and
  mute-in-background.
- Online: Insignia, XLink Kai and System Link.
- 11 languages, the system's by default; the console's language follows.
- Any window size, aspect ratio and DPI.

### Platforms
- Windows 10/11 x64: a portable folder, system DLLs only.
- Linux x86-64: an AppImage (glibc 2.35 or newer: Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12,
  Fedora 36 and later); settings in `~/.local/share/xbased`.
