/*
 * hakuX native core — one faulting x86-64 instruction run against a
 * buffer instead of its memory operand (Windows): the device registers'
 * accesses (core/mmio.c) and the dirty tracking's emulated stores
 * (hle/dirty.c), from translated code and host code alike.
 *
 * nc_x64_access decodes the instruction at the CONTEXT's RIP: the host
 * address and size of its memory operand, whether it reads and writes it.
 * nc_x64_run then runs it with that operand replaced by data (filled from
 * the device or RAM beforehand when it reads; to be stored afterwards when
 * it writes), the registers, flags and x87/SSE state taken from and put
 * back in the CONTEXT, and RIP moved past it.
